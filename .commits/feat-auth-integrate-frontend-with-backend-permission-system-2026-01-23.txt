feat(auth): integrate frontend with backend permission system

Implements the client-side functionality to fetch, manage, and utilize
user permissions from the backend.

- Creates a new `use-permissions` hook to fetch permissions from the
  `/api/permissions/me` endpoint.
- Updates `AuthProvider` to store user permissions in the global auth context.
- Exposes a `hasPermission` function via the `useAuth` hook, allowing for
  conditional UI rendering based on user rights.
- Adds permission-related schemas to the `@vivero/shared` package to ensure
  type safety.
- Replaces the main dashboard loading spinner with a skeleton component
  for an improved user experience.
- Refactors the `use-authUser` hook from `.tsx` to `.ts`.

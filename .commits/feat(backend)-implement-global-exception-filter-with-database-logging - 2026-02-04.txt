feat(backend): implement global exception filter with database logging

This commit introduces a new `GlobalExceptionFilter` that replaces the
previous `SecurityExceptionFilter`. The new filter is a global error
handler that catches all exceptions in the backend.

Key features:
- Catches all exceptions, not just `HttpException`.
- Logs detailed error information to the `audit_log` table in the database.
- Handles Prisma-specific errors.
- Provides a more detailed and structured error response.

This change enhances the security and observability of the application by
providing a persistent record of all errors.

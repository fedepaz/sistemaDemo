feat(frontend): implement permission-based dynamic sidebar

Replaces the static sidebar with a dynamic navigation menu that renders
links based on the authenticated user's permissions.

- Introduces a central `NAVIGATION_CONFIG` to define all possible
  sidebar links and their required permissions.
- The `DesktopSidebar` component now consumes permissions from the `AuthContext`.
- A `useMemo` hook filters the navigation config, only showing links
  for which the user has `canRead` access.
- Expands the `ROUTES` constant to include all new application sections.

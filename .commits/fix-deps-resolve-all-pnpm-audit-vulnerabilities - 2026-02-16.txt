fix(deps): resolve all pnpm audit vulnerabilities

Resolved all reported pnpm audit vulnerabilities, including the low-severity
ones, by adding overrides to the `pnpm.overrides` section in `package.json`.

Specifically addressed:
- `@isaacs/brace-expansion`: Upgraded to `>=5.0.1` to fix a high-severity
  uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability.
- `webpack`: Upgraded to `>=5.104.1` to fix multiple low-severity SSRF
  vulnerabilities.
- `qs`: Upgraded to `>=6.14.2` to fix a low-severity arrayLimit bypass denial
  of service vulnerability.

Also, updated dev dependencies to their latest versions and removed `text-white`
from a button class in `apps/frontend/src/components/user-profile/user-edit.tsx`
for consistency.

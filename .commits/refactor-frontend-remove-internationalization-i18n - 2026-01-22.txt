refactor(frontend): remove internationalization (i18n)

Removes the internationalization (i18n) implementation from the frontend.

This change aligns the codebase with the documented "Spanish-only"
architectural standard, which does not require an i18n library.

- Deleted all translation files (`messages/{en,es,it}/*.json`).
- Removed the `[locale]` parameter from the routing structure.
- Simplified the application by removing unused i18n infrastructure.

feat(frontend): improve UX/UI by standardizing color usage

Refactor frontend components to eliminate hardcoded color values and
leverage the semantic color palette defined in the design system. This
ensures consistency, improves maintainability, and enhances the overall
user experience by adhering to established UX/UI guidelines.

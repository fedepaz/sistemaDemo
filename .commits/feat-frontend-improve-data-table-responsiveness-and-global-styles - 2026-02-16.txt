feat(frontend): improve data-table responsiveness and global styles

Refactored the `DataTable` component to be responsive, adjusting the
number of visible columns based on screen breakpoints. This provides a
better user experience on smaller devices.

- Implemented `useBreakpoint` hook to detect screen size changes.
- Added an `useEffect` to dynamically set column visibility.
- Adjusted global CSS to improve layout on mobile devices, especially
  for safe areas.
- Removed `overflow: hidden` to allow scrolling on pages with long content.

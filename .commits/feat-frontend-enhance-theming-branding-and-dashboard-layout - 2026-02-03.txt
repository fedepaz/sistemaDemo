feat(frontend): enhance theming, branding, and dashboard layout

- Implemented theme-aware colors in dashboard-alerts and dashboard-kpi components
  using chart-specific CSS variables for dynamic theming.
- Updated application branding with a custom SVG favicon ("DM" logo) and changed
  the global title to "Sistema de gestión".
- Refactored `ComingSoonPage` for a simpler, branded placeholder.
- Adjusted dashboard layout padding and removed UserKPIs from the UsersDashboard.
- Optimized `desktop-sidebar.tsx` JSX structure without functional changes.
- Removed unused `useState` import from `useIsMounted.ts`.

feat(backend): improve database connection handling and resilience

- Implemented `executeWithRetry` in `PrismaService` to handle transient database
  connection errors, such as pool timeouts.
- Added `onModuleDestroy` hook to `PrismaService` for graceful database disconnection.
- Added a health check query (`SELECT 1`) after initial connection to verify
  database responsiveness.
- Removed SSL connection for local development and seeding scripts to simplify
  the local setup.
- Made database connection logging conditional to avoid verbose logs in production.

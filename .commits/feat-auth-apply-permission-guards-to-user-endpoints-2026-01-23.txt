feat(auth): apply permission guards to user endpoints

Secures the user-related API endpoints by applying the
`@RequirePermission` decorator.

- All endpoints in `UsersController` now require specific permissions
  (e.g., reading your own profile vs. reading all users).
- Adds a new Prisma seed script (`seed-permissions.ts`) to populate
  initial user permissions in the database.
- Includes a minor stylistic refactor to the decorator itself.

feat(core): enhance error handling and debugging across the stack

This commit introduces several improvements to error handling, debugging, and authentication logic.

Frontend:
- Implemented a specific error handler for network failures, providing clearer feedback to the user when the server is unreachable.
- Added extensive console.log statements throughout the API client and error provider to improve traceability and simplify debugging of client-side errors.
- Refactored the signOut process to more robustly clear and cancel client-side queries, preventing potential race conditions.

Backend:
- Removed the manual `updatedAt` timestamp update in the user repository, deferring to the ORM for more reliable and consistent timestamp management.
- Added temporary logging to the user profile update endpoint for debugging purposes.

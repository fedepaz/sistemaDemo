feat(auth): implement user password change functionality

This commit introduces the necessary backend and frontend components to allow users
to change their password.

Backend changes:
- Adds a new PATCH /auth/password endpoint to `auth.controller.ts` for handling
  password change requests.
- Implements the `changePassword` method in `auth.service.ts` to validate current
  passwords, hash new passwords using `bcrypt`, and update the user record.
- Extends `UserAuthRepository` with an `updatePassword` method to persist the new
  password hash.
- Ensures the `updatedAt` timestamp is updated in `users.repository.ts` when a user
  record is modified.
- Leverages `@RequirePermission` for authorization and `ZodValidationPipe` for
  input validation.

Frontend changes:
- Prepares `user-menu.tsx` to include a new "password" tab, allowing users to
  navigate to the password change form.
- The styling change in `user-edit.tsx` (removal of `text-white`) is a minor
  cleanup.

This feature enhances user security and provides self-service capabilities for
account management.

feat(husky): configure Husky for updated branch strategy and project name

This commit configures Husky to align with recent project changes:

- Updated Protected Branches: The pre-commit hook now recognizes 'main' and 'dev'
  as protected branches, reflecting the consolidation of 'frontendDev' and
  'backendDev' into a single 'dev' branch.
- Project Renaming: The 'package.json' has been updated to reflect the new
  project name, 'vivero-client-alpha'.
- Husky Prepare Script: The 'prepare' script in 'package.json' has been updated
  to the recommended 'husky' for modern Husky versions, ensuring proper hook
  initialization.

These changes enhance development workflow by enforcing consistent branch usage
and linting before commits.

## 🚀 **The Mindset**

**Think like a customer, not a developer:**
- "Would a business CTO pay €50k for this?"
- "Does this solve a real €100k+ problem for them?"
- "Can I demo this feature in 5 minutes?"

**Embrace "good enough":**
- Perfect code doesn't pay the bills.
- Customers pay for working solutions, not beautiful architecture.

**Target: First paying customer in 6 months with 384 hours of focused work.**

## 🛠️ **Essential Tools & Shortcuts**

### Development Productivity
```bash
# Essential VS Code extensions
- ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets
- Prisma (syntax highlighting)
- Auto Rename Tag
- GitLens
- Error Lens
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense

# Time-saving pnpm scripts
pnpm dev          # Start everything
pnpm test:quick   # Fast tests only
pnpm db:reset     # Quick database reset
pnpm type-check   # Quick TypeScript check
```

### AI-Assisted Development
```bash
# Use AI for:
- Code generation (components, APIs)
- Test writing
- Documentation
- Translation content
- Email templates
- Marketing copy

# Don't use AI for:
- Architecture decisions
- Business logic
- Database schema design
- Security configurations
```

### Time Management
```bash
# Pomodoro Technique: 25 min work / 5 min break
# Time tracking: Toggle/Clockify
# Focus: Block social media during dev hours
# Breaks: Every 2 hours, step away from computer
```

## 🚨 **Risk Mitigation**

### Technical Risks
```typescript
Risk: "Over-engineering early features"
Mitigation: Stick to MVP, resist feature creep

Risk: "Authentication complexity"
Mitigation: Use Clerk, don't build custom auth

Risk: "Database performance issues"  
Mitigation: Index properly, use Prisma query optimization

Risk: "Frontend complexity"
Mitigation: Use proven patterns, MUI components
```

### Business Risks
```typescript
Risk: "No trial signups"
Mitigation: Validate landing page with real prospects first

Risk: "Trials don't convert"
Mitigation: Interview trial users, iterate quickly

Risk: "Wrong target market"
Mitigation: Research 3 specific companies before building

Risk: "Pricing too low/high"
Mitigation: Research competitor pricing, value-based pricing
```

### Time Risks
```typescript
Risk: "Scope creep eating time"
Mitigation: Strict weekly goals, feature freeze after Phase 3

Risk: "Getting stuck on complex features"
Mitigation: 2-hour rule: if stuck, simplify or ask for help

Risk: "Perfectionism"
Mitigation: "Good enough" mentality for MVP features
```

## 💡 **Success Accelerators**

### Customer Development (Parallel to coding)
```bash

Week 13-16: Close beta with 2 friendly prospects
Week 17+:   Convert beta users to paying customers
```

### Marketing Preparation

## ✅ **Daily Reality Check**

### Before Each Coding Session
- [ ] What specific outcome will this 8-hour session achieve?
- [ ] How does this get me closer to the first €50k customer?
- [ ] Am I building features or solving real customer problems?
- [ ] Can I demo this to a prospect?

### After Each Coding Session
- [ ] Can I ship this increment to production?
- [ ] What did I learn about the customer problem?
- [ ] What will I build in the next session?
- [ ] Am I still on track for the phase goals?

---

## 🚀 **The Mindset**

**Think like a customer, not a developer:**
- "Would a Dutch tulip farm CTO pay €50k for this?"
- "Does this solve a real €100k+ problem for them?"
- "Can I demo this feature in 5 minutes?"

**Embrace "good enough":**
- Perfect code doesn't pay the bills
- Customers pay for working solutions, not beautiful architecture
- You can always refactor after you have revenue

**Stay customer-obsessed:**
- Code 70% of the time
- Customer research 20% of the time  
- Marketing/sales 10% of the time

---

> **Remember**: You're not building the perfect plant management system. You're building the first system good enough that enterprise customers will pay €50k+ because it solves their expensive problems better than Excel spreadsheets.

**Ship fast. Learn faster. Get paid fastest.** 🚀💰

**Target: First paying customer in 6 months with 384 hours of focused work.**

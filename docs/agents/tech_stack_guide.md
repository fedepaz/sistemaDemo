## 🏛️ Architecture Decisions

### Multi-Tenancy Strategy

```typescript
Pattern: Database-per-tenant (maximum isolation)

Rationale:
✅ Complete data isolation (security requirement)
✅ Easy backup/restore per client
✅ Custom schemas per tenant possible
✅ Regulatory compliance (GDPR)
❌ More complex deployment
❌ Higher infrastructure costs
✅ Worth it for enterprise clients paying €50k+
```

### Authentication Strategy

```typescript
Authentication Workflow:
The platform uses a traditional username/password authentication model managed by the backend.
```

### Caching Strategy

```typescript
Multi-Level Caching:
L1: React Query (browser cache) - 5 minutes
L2: Valkey (server cache) - 1 hour
L3: Database query optimization - indexes
L4: CDN (static assets) - 30 days
```

---

## 🚀 Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Required software versions
Node.js: 18.18.0+
pnpm: 8.15.0+
Docker: 24.0+
MariaDB: 10.9+
Valkey: 7.2+
```

---

## 🔒 Security Configuration

```typescript
✅ JWT tokens with short expiration (15 min access + refresh tokens)
✅ Rate limiting (100 requests/minute per IP)
✅ Input validation with Zod schemas
✅ SQL injection prevention (Prisma ORM)
✅ XSS protection (helmet middleware)
✅ CORS configuration
✅ Environment variable validation
✅ API key rotation strategy
✅ Audit logging for all data changes
✅ Encryption at rest (database + file storage)
✅ TLS 1.3 for all connections
✅ Regular dependency updates (Dependabot)
```

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics to Track

```typescript
Business Metrics:
- Trial conversion rate (target: 25%)
- Average lead score
- Trial usage patterns
- Revenue per customer
- Customer acquisition cost
- Time to first value (trial onboarding)

Technical Metrics:
- API response times (p95 < 200ms)
- Error rates (< 0.1%)
- Database query performance
- Cache hit rates
- Server resource usage
- Uptime (99.9% SLA)
```

---

## 🎯 Performance Targets

### Response Time Requirements

```typescript
Target Performance (95th percentile):
- Landing pages: < 1 second
- Dashboard loads: < 2 seconds
- API endpoints: < 200ms
- Database queries: < 100ms
- Trial signup: < 3 seconds
- Entity creation: < 500ms
- Report generation: < 5 seconds
- File uploads: < 10 seconds
```

### Scalability Targets

```typescript
System Capacity:
- Concurrent users: 10,000+
- API requests/second: 1,000+
- Database connections: 500+
- Records per tenant: 1,000,000+
- File storage: 10TB+
- Trial tenants: 1,000+ simultaneously
```

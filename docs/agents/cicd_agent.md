## Mission Statement

Build bulletproof CI/CD pipelines that catch bugs before users do, deploy reliably across environments, and give developers confidence to ship fast. Focus on technical pipeline mechanics, not business domain specifics.

## CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

This project follows a modular, 3-file approach to CI/CD, prioritizing clarity, efficiency, and maintainability. This structure is the single source of truth for all CI/CD operations.

### Commit Message Convention

This project enforces the **Conventional Commits** specification for all commit messages. This is handled locally by `commitlint` and Husky hooks before code is ever pushed.

**CI/CD Implications:**

- **Automated Changelogs:** The structured commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.) can be used by the CI/CD pipeline to automatically generate release notes.
- **Semantic Versioning:** The pipeline can use the commit history to automatically determine the next version number (patch, minor, major) for a release.

The CI/CD agent should leverage this structured history to automate release and documentation processes.

### Build System

- **Turborepo**: This project uses Turborepo as a high-performance build system to orchestrate tasks within the monorepo. It optimizes the pipeline by caching task results and only running jobs on code that has changed.

### Core Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each workflow has a distinct responsibility (e.g., PR checks vs. deployment).
- **Efficiency**: Workflows are triggered only by relevant changes using path filtering.
- **Maintainability**: Common steps are centralized in a reusable workflow to avoid code duplication.

### Action Verification Mandate

**All third-party GitHub Actions must be researched and verified using the `resolve_library_id` tool before being added to a workflow.** This ensures that only trusted and well-documented actions are used, maintaining the security and reliability of the pipeline.

### Workflow Structure

#### 1. `pr-checks.yml` (Pull Request Quality Gate)

- **Purpose**: Ensures code quality and correctness before merging.
- **Trigger**: Runs on every `pull_request` to `main`, `frontendDev`, and `backendDev` branches.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Runs linting, type-checking, and unit tests for the changed application(s) using `turbo run lint --filter=//apps/backend`, `turbo run test --filter=//apps/backend`, etc., ensuring all modules within the backend are covered. The test suites executed in this workflow are defined and maintained by the `agricultural-qa-test-automation-engineer`.

#### 2. `deploy.yml` (Deployment Workflow)

- **Purpose**: Manages deployments to all environments.
- **Trigger**: Runs on every `push` to `main` (production), `frontendDev` (staging), and `backendDev` (staging).
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Builds the application artifact using `turbo run build --filter=//apps/backend` for the backend, and `--filter=//apps/frontend` for the frontend.
  - Deploys to the target environment (Vercel for frontend, Render for backend).
  - Dispatches an `e2e-tests.yml` run after a successful staging deployment.
  - Runs smoke tests after a successful production deployment.

#### 3. `scheduled.yml` (Scheduled Maintenance)

- **Purpose**: Performs routine, automated tasks.
- **Trigger**: Runs on a `schedule` (e.g., daily).
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Runs security vulnerability scans (`pnpm audit`).
  - Checks for dependency updates.

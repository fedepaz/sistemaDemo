### Layout Overrides

- **Max Width:** 800px (narrow, focused)
- **Layout:** Single column, centered
- **Sections:** 1. Hero (Value Prop + Form), 2. Recent Issues/Archives, 3. Social Proof (Subscriber count), 4. About Author

### Spacing Overrides

- **Content Density:** Low — focus on clarity

### Typography Overrides

### Component Overrides

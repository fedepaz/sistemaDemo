feat(backend): improve database connection handling and resilience

Enhances the `PrismaService` to include a retry mechanism for database connections,
improving application resilience against transient database availability issues.
The connection logic now attempts to connect up to 5 times with a 3-second delay
between attempts, specifically addressing connection timeouts or refusals.
Additionally, sensitive database credentials are no longer logged, even in development
environments, aligning with security best practices.

The changes include:
- Implemented a retry loop for database connection with a maximum of 5 attempts
  and a 3-second delay.
- Enhanced logging to provide clearer feedback on connection attempts, successes,
  and failures, distinguishing between transient and persistent errors.
- Removed the logging of sensitive database configuration details (host, port,
  username, password, database name) to improve security.

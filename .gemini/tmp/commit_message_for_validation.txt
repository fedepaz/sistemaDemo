feat(users): implement base repository and user recovery functionality

This commit introduces significant improvements to user data management:
- **BaseRepository Adoption:** The `UsersRepository` now extends a new `BaseRepository`
  class, centralizing common CRUD operations and enforcing tenant-aware filtering. This
  reduces boilerplate, improves consistency, and aligns with best practices for data
  access layer abstraction in NestJS with Prisma. The `findById`, `findAll`, and
  `findAllAdmin` methods have been removed from `UsersRepository` as they are now
  handled by the `BaseRepository`.
- **User Recovery:** Implemented a `recoverById` method in `UsersRepository` and a
  corresponding `PATCH /users/:userId/recover` endpoint in `UsersController`. This
  allows for the re-activation of previously soft-deleted user accounts,
  complementing the existing soft-delete mechanism.
- **Endpoint Renaming:** The `softDeleteUserByUsername` method in `UsersService` was
  renamed to `softRemoveUserByUsername`, and the corresponding controller call was
  updated.

Documentation updates have been proposed to reflect these changes in
`agricultural-backend-agent.md`, specifically for the `BaseRepository` pattern, the
`recoverById` method, and the `@RequirePermission` decorator.

Security findings have been noted in `apps/backend/src/modules/users/users.controller.ts`
regarding redundant permission checks and an incorrect permission action. These will be
addressed in a follow-up.

refactor(frontend): simplify authentication and remove internationalization

This commit refactors the frontend by:
- Removing the third-party Clerk authentication library in favor of the custom
  username/password authentication model managed by the backend, aligning with
  `tech_stack_guide.md` and `product-manager-agent.md`.
- Eliminating `next-intl` internationalization, hardcoding all UI text to Spanish,
  and simplifying routing by removing locale-based dynamic paths. This streamlines
  the frontend for a Spanish-only application.
- Updating the project name to "Vivero" in the frontend's metadata.
- Adjusting frontend layout and page structures to reflect the removal of i18n
  and Clerk.

Additionally, this commit updates `GEMINI.md` to clarify the testing mandate, detail
the database schema change workflow, and refine the commit and push workflow,
improving agent operational guidelines.
